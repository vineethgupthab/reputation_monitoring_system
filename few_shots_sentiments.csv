Fallon will receive about $2.3 million while Walker River has been approved for more than $4.3 million. “Helping Tribal communities across Nevada build more homes for working families is a top priority of mine, and I’m proud to help deliver this federal funding that will provide families with the support and resources they need to improve their quality of life,” said U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. Cortez Masto said federal funding has already supported new tribal housing across Nevada, including new middle-class family homes in Owyhee and Washoe Valley in just the past year. “The housing crisis in Nevada is impacting everyone in our state, especially tribal communities,” said fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen. “I’m proud to announce this funding for affordable housing development for tribes across Nevada. I’ll keep working to bring more federal investments to ensure that tribal communities have the resources they need.” Cortez Masto secured $4.8 million in 2022 from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco to support Nevada affordable housing organizations including tribes, and to cut through red tape to make it easier to build affordable housing across the state.

"This is the news article Teresa Bryce Bazemore, who held a front-row seat during the bank liquidity crisis this year as president and CEO of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, plans to retire when her term expires in 2024, citing personal reasons. The San Francisco bank's board chose not to renew Bazemore's contract after she asked to retire in 2025, though her contract expires in 2024. The board instead initiated a search for a new CEO, said Simone Lagomarsino, the board's chairman, who also is president and CEO at Luther Burbank Savings. Bazemore ""indicated that, due to personal and other considerations, she would like to retire in March 2025,"" Lagomarsino said in a press release. ""As a result, and in consultation with Teresa, the board has decided to move forward with a search to identify a new CEO who will deliver long-term continuity and engaged leadership."" The decision followed ""extensive deliberation and discussion"" about the Home Loan bank's long-term goals, including ""the implementation and integration of strategic changes that may arise from the 'FHLBank System at 100' review currently being conducted by the Federal Housing Finance Agency,"" Lagomarsino said in the release. ""The board recognized the critical importance of a CEO who would be engaged for the next several years to lead the organization forward and implement a vision and strategy to align with the outcome of the FHFA's review."" The San Francisco Home Loan Bank played a central role in the bank liquidity crisis in March, when it served as lender of next-to-last-resort to Silicon Valley Bank, which was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and ultimately sold to First Citizens BancShares in Raleigh, N.C. Other major borrowers of the San Francisco Home Loan bank this year included San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which was sold to JPMorgan Chase in May, and Silvergate Bank of La Jolla, Calif., which self-liquidated in March. Last year, Bazemore earned $2.4 million, which included a base salary of $910,000 and other incentive compensation. When she joined the San Francisco Home Loan bank in 2021, she received a $100,000 signing bonus. Her employment agreement provides for 12 months of severance pay, equal to her base salary, plus other awards, according to the Home Loan banks' combined financial report for 2022. Last year, the Federal Housing Finance Agency that oversees that Home Loan bank system, launched a holistic review of the government-sponsored enterprise, its first in 90 years. Critics have questioned the system's hybrid public-private business model and whether the banks are engaged in the primary mission of supporting housing. FHFA Director Sandra Thompson is set to issue a report with policy and congressional recommendations sometime later this year. Separately, Fitch Ratings on Thursday downgraded certain ratings of the Federal Home Loan banks of Atlanta and Des Moines citing the ""high and growing general government debt burden,"" of the U.S. government. The ratings actions followed the downgrade of the U.S. to 'AA+,' from 'AAA.' The Home Loan banks are bank cooperatives that provide low-cost funding to 6,500 members including banks, insurance companies and credit unions. Created in 1932 to bolster housing during the Depression, the system incentivizes banks to buy mortgage-backed securities and agency bonds that can be pledged as collateral in exchange for liquidity. related to Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.
